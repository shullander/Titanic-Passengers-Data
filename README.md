# Titanic-Passengers-Data
This is a Repository created for Professor Gotzler's English 105 Class at UNC Chapel Hill.
## Contents
This repository contains a [.csv file](train.csv) that contains a dataset of real Titanic Passengers.

  *Note that the dataset does not contain **all** Titanic Passengers*
  
This Repository also contains a Python Notebook with instructions on creating a subset of this data.
## About the Data
The data in the train.csv file was created to be used in a [machine learning competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview) on the website, Kaggle. The dataset that I used is a subset of 891 passengers containing information about them such as name, age, sex, ticket class, etc. it also includes whether or not they survived. In this competition, participants create a machine learning model that can predict survival outcomes of other passengers. To train their model, participants will use patterns found in the train.csv file. The participants would then test their model on a different subset of passengers (not included in this repository) that doesn't contain survival outcomes. The participants compete to create the most accurate predictions.

This repository explores some simple ways to analyze this data and look for patterns.
